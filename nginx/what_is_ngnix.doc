 What is NGINX? (The Full Story)
NGINX (pronounced "engine-x") is a high-performance web server and reverse proxy server created by Igor Sysoev in 2004. It was originally designed to solve the C10K problem â€” how to handle 10,000+ simultaneous connections â€” which older web servers like Apache struggled with.

But over the years, NGINX evolved into a complete application delivery platform.

ðŸ“¦ What Can NGINX Do?
NGINX isnâ€™t just one tool â€” it's multiple tools packed into one:

Purpose	What It Means
Web Server	Serves static files: HTML, CSS, JS, images, etc.
Reverse Proxy	Forwards client requests to backend servers
Load Balancer	Distributes traffic across multiple servers
API Gateway	Routes API requests, handles security, authentication, etc.
Content Cache	Caches static and dynamic content to reduce load on backend
TLS/SSL Termination	Handles HTTPS encryption, reducing the burden on backend
Streaming Server	Serves live media streams using protocols like RTMP

ðŸ§  How NGINX Works (In Simple Terms)
NGINX is asynchronous and event-driven, unlike Apache which is thread-based. That means:

It doesnâ€™t create a new process/thread for every connection.

One worker can handle thousands of connections efficiently.

It uses a non-blocking architecture â€” no waiting around like Apache does.

This is why itâ€™s blazing fast and perfect for handling modern high-traffic websites and APIs.
