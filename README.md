# DevOps Study and Roadmap 🚀

Welcome to my personal DevOps learning space!  
Here, I’m documenting everything I learn while building skills in DevOps — from basic commands to full project pipelines.

## 📁 Folder Structure

- `docker/` – Docker concepts, commands, examples
- `git/` – Git essentials and workflow
- `jenkins/` – Jenkins installation and pipelines
- `linux/` – Linux commands and scripting
- `nginx/` – Web server setup and config

## 🧠 What's Inside

- Real hands-on examples  
- Configuration files  
- Setup guides  
- My personal notes and scripts  

## 📅 Ongoing Goals

- Master core DevOps tools  
- Build CI/CD pipelines  
- Practice Infrastructure as Code  
- Share learnings publicly 💪

## 🚧 Disclaimer

This repo is a **learning sandbox** — things might be messy, experimental, or in-progress. Feedback is always welcome!

Let’s grow, fail, learn, and improve — one command at a time.
